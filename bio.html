        <h1>Biography</h1>
	<span class="section"><h1>Early Days</h1></span>
	<p>I was born on November 11th, 1920. Exactly where I can't tell you. My parents both died in a climbing accident. I grew up in Pett Bottom, in the south east of the UK. Even then I had an affection for the ladies.</p>
  
	<span class="section"><h1>Career</h1></span>
	<p>I'm a <span class="emphasize">00</span> agent for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service>MI6</a>. That's all I can tell you. For the most part my job is top secret. However a couple events involving myself have leaked, and are published in accounts documented by Mr. Fleming. I hear they're becoming quite popular reads.</p>

	<span class="section"><h1>Personality <span class="de-emphasize">and</span> Persona</h1></span>
	<p>My favorite drink is the Vesper, named after someone special to me. Gordon's gin, vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet, shaken (not stirred), completed with a thin lemon slice. I'm sure you've heard of something like that before. I'm a heaver smoker and drinker. Perhaps addicted. Probably addicted. I cut back to twenty five a day from some advice after a shaky experience. Luckily neither vice affects my performance, job related or otherwise.</p>
