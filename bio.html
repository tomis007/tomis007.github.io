  <h1>My Biography</h1>
  <h3>Early Days</h3>
  <p>I was born on November 11th, 1920. Exactly where I can't tell you. My parents both died in a climbing accident. I grew up in Pett Bottom, in the south east of the UK. Even then I had an affection for the ladies.</p>
  <h3>Career</h3>
  <p>I'm a 00 agent for MI6. That's all I can tell you. Occasionally my exploits make the news. I'm sure you're familiar with some of my work.</p>
  <h3>Personality and Persona</h3>
  <p>My favorite drink is the Vesper, named after someone special to me. Gordon's, vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet, shaken (not stirred), and a thin lemon slice. I'm sure you've heard of something like that before. I'm a heaver smoker and drinker. Perhaps addicted. Probably addicted. I cut back to twenty five a day from some advice after a shaky experience. Luckily neither vice affects my performance, job related or otherwise.</p>
